## What problem does this solve?

Firebase Storage is a great way to store user generated content. However, it does not provide a way to filter out explicit content. This extension uses the [Google Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision) to detect explicit content in images uploaded to Firebase Storage. It then blurs the image and replaces the original image with the blurred version.

## How does it work?

```mermaid
graph TD
  upload[User uploads an image to Firebase Storage]
  function[Cloud Function gets triggered, calls Cloud Vission API]
  explicit{Image contains explicit content?}
  download[Download image]
  blur[Blur & compress image]
  replace[Upload blurred image and replace original]
  store[Store Firestore document with details]
  noAction[No action required]

  upload --> function
  function --> explicit
  explicit -- Yes --> download
  download --> blur
  blur --> replace
  replace --> store
  explicit -- No --> noAction
```

## Additional setup

Before installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Storage bucket](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage) in your Firebase project.

> **NOTE**: As mentioned above, this extension listens for all changes made to the specified Cloud Storage bucket. This may cause unnecessary function calls. It is recommended to create a separate Cloud Storage bucket, especially for images you want to resize, and set up this extension to listen to that bucket.
